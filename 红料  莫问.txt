莫问什么对错 
Don't ask what's right or wrong
若生命是荒漠 
If life is a desert
你是荒漠里绽放的，我最美的花朵 
You're the one who blossomed in the desert, my most beautiful flower

莫问什么对错
Don't ask what's right or wrong
若生命是荒漠
If life is a desert
你是荒漠里流过的，我潺潺的小河 
You're the one who flowed through the desert, my babbling brook

说什么相聚难 
Don't say that meeting was so hard
说什么离别错 
Don’t say that parting was wrong
我是你忘不了的泪落
You're my tear drop that I can't forget
你是我求不得的结果 
You're the outcome that I can't beg for

光阴似水 
Time is like water
人世轻薄 
Our world is frivolous
若你能忘了我 
If you can forget me
愿你能忘了我
Hope you can forget me
